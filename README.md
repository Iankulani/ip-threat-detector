# ip-threat-detector
The IP Threat Detector is a simple TypeScript tool that checks a given IP address for potential threats. It simulates detecting issues such as suspicious activity, open ports, and possible DoS or DDoS attempts. Users can enter an IP address, and the tool responds with a risk status.
